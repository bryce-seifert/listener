# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to **security@bitfocus.io**, or via
GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
on this repository. Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability.

Include a description, affected version (`version.json` / the version shown in
the GUI footer), platform, and reproduction steps. We aim to acknowledge within
five business days.

## Threat model — read this before deploying

Bitfocus Listener is, by design, a **remote-control server that executes input
and shell commands on the host machine**. An authenticated client can type
keystrokes, move and click the mouse, open files, and — when enabled — run
arbitrary shell commands and AppleScript. Treat access to the listener as
equivalent to interactive access to the machine.

### What the design does and does not give you

- **No transport encryption.** Traffic is plain `ws://`. Anyone on the network
  path can read commands and the challenge/response exchange. Run Listener only
  on trusted, segmented networks, or tunnel it (SSH, WireGuard, a TLS reverse
  proxy).
- **Authentication is MD5 challenge-response.** The server sends a random
  per-connection salt; the client replies with `MD5(salt + password)`. This
  keeps the password off the wire, but MD5 is not a modern primitive and the
  scheme provides no forward secrecy and no server authentication. It exists for
  compatibility with Bitfocus Companion modules.
- **Failed authentication is rate-limited per source IP** (5 attempts, 2 s
  cooldown, 5 min lockout) and survives reconnects.
- **Any origin may connect.** The WebSocket upgrade does not check `Origin`, so
  a web page in a browser on the same machine (or one that can resolve to it)
  can open a connection. It still cannot act without the password, but it can
  reach the auth endpoint. Bind to a specific interface and firewall the port.
- **Default bind is `0.0.0.0`.** The listener is reachable from the whole
  network unless you change the interface in the GUI.
- **The password is stored in cleartext** in `~/.bitfocus_listener.config`
  (mode `0600`) because the challenge-response scheme needs the original value.

### Reducing exposure

1. Bind to `127.0.0.1` if only local clients need access.
2. In **Security → Allowed Remote Actions**, disable everything you do not use.
   `shellRun` and `osxAppleScript` execute arbitrary operator-supplied code and
   are the highest-value targets.
3. In **Security → Key Access Control**, switch to *Restricted* and allow only
   the keys you need.
4. Rotate the password (**Generate New**) if it may have been exposed; this
   disconnects all connected clients.
5. Review `~/.bitfocus_listener.log` — every command, auth attempt, and settings
   change is recorded with source IP.

### Out of scope

- The ability of an *authenticated* client to run commands that are explicitly
  enabled in the configuration. That is the product.
- Attacks requiring an attacker who already has local code execution as the same
  user (they can read the config file directly).
